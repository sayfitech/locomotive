# locomotive

A Railway sidecar service for sending webhook events when new logs are received.

Nearly equivalent to Heroku's log drain, but for Railway.

With tailored support for:

- Datadog
- Axiom
- BetterStack
- Loki
- Sentry
- Papertrail

And more with the standard JSON and JSON Lines modes.

## Configuration

Configuration is done through environment variables. See explanation and examples below.

**Notes:**

- Metadata such as the project, service, and environment names, along with their IDs, are automatically added to the logs that are sent under a `_metadata` attribute.

- Metadata is gathered on startup and then approximately every 10 to 20 minutes. If a project, service, or environment name has changed, the name in the metadata will not be correct until the locomotive refreshes its metadata.

- The root attributes in the HTTP logs are subject to change as Railway adds or removes attributes.

### All variables:

- `LOCOMOTIVE_RAILWAY_API_KEY` - Your Railway API token.

    **Required**.

    - Project-level tokens do not work.
    - Team-scoped tokens do not work.

    Generate a [Railway API Token](https://railway.com/account/tokens)

    </br>

- `LOCOMOTIVE_ENVIRONMENT_ID` - The ID of the environment your services are in.

    **Required**.

    - Auto-filled to the current environment ID.

    Make sure to deploy Locomotive into the same environment as the services you want to monitor.

    [Railway Best Practices](https://docs.railway.com/overview/best-practices#deploying-related-services-into-the-same-project)

    Upon startup, Locomotive will verify that all the services exist within the set environment. If the environment does not exist, Locomotive will exit with an API error message.

    If that check fails with an unauthorized error, you are likely using the wrong kind of API token.

    </br>

- `LOCOMOTIVE_SERVICE_IDS` - The IDs of the services you want to monitor.

    **Required**.

    - Supports a single service ID.
    - Supports multiple service IDs, separated with a comma.

    Upon startup, Locomotive will verify that all the services exist within the set environment. If any services do not exist, Locomotive will exit with an error and provide a list of the missing services.

    If that check fails with an unauthorized error, you are likely using the wrong kind of API token.

    </br>

- `LOCOMOTIVE_WEBHOOK_URL` - The URL to send the webhook to.

    **Required**.

    - Example for Datadog: `https://http-intake.logs.datadoghq.com/api/v2/logs`
    - Example for Axiom: `https://api.axiom.co/v1/datasets/<DATASET_NAME>/ingest`
    - Example for BetterStack: `https://in.logs.betterstack.com`

    See [Provider specific setup](#provider-specific-setup) for more information.

    </br>

- `LOCOMOTIVE_ADDITIONAL_HEADERS` - Any additional headers to be sent with the request.

    **Optional**.

    - Useful for authentication. The string is in the format of a cookie, meaning each key-value pair is separated by a semicolon, and each key and value are separated by an equals sign.

    - Example for Datadog: `ADDITIONAL_HEADERS=DD-API-KEY=<DD_API_KEY>;DD-APPLICATION-KEY=<DD_APP_KEY>`
    - Example for Axiom/BetterStack: `ADDITIONAL_HEADERS=Authorization=Bearer <API_TOKEN>`

    See [Provider specific setup](#provider-specific-setup) for more information.

    </br>

- `LOCOMOTIVE_WEBHOOK_MODE` - The mode to use for the webhook.

    **Optional**.

    - Default: `json`
    
    Currently supported modes:

    - `json`
    - `jsonl`
    - `papertrail`
    - `datadog`
    - `axiom`
    - `betterstack`
    - `loki`
    - `sentry`

    </br>

- `LOCOMOTIVE_REPORT_STATUS_EVERY` - Reports the status of the locomotive every 5 seconds.

    **Optional**.

    - Default: `1m`
    - Format must be in the Golang `time.DurationParse` format
        - E.g. `10h`, `5h`, `10m`, `5m 5s`

    </br>

- `LOCOMOTIVE_ENABLE_HTTP_LOGS` - Enable transport of HTTP logs.

    **Optional**.

    - Default: `false`

    </br>

- `LOCOMOTIVE_ENABLE_DEPLOY_LOGS` - Enable transport of deploy logs.

    **Optional**.

    - Default: `true`

    </br>

- `LOCOMOTIVE_MIN_SEVERITY` - Minimum log severity level to forward.

    **Optional**.

    - Default: `debug`
    - Logs below this severity will be ignored.

    Supported values (case-insensitive):

    - `debug`
    - `info`
    - `warn`
    - `error`
    - `fatal`

    Example:

    ```bash
    LOCOMOTIVE_MIN_SEVERITY=warn
    ```

    This will forward only:
    - `warn`
    - `error`
    - `fatal`
    -

- `LOCOMOTIVE_WEBHOOK_URL` - `https://<LOKI_HOSTNAME>/loki/api/v1/push`

    The hostname would depend on where you are running Loki.

    Or, with username and password authentication:
